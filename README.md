# Family Foundations

This is an interactive educational application built with **Elixir** and **Phoenix LiveView**. It provides a digital flashcard experience designed to help children learn names, sounds, and descriptions of animals, shapes, and foods.

The project demonstrates core functional programming concepts in Elixir, including **recursion**, **pattern matching**, **guards**, and **state management** within a LiveView process. By leveraging the **Erlang VM (BEAM)**, the app is built for high concurrency and fault tolerance.

## Instructions for Build and Use

### Steps to build and run the software:

1. **Install Dependencies:** In the project directory, run `mix deps.get` to install the Phoenix and Elixir dependencies.
2. **Database Setup:** Ensure PostgreSQL is running and run `mix ecto.setup` to create and migrate your database.
3. **Assets Setup:** Run `mix assets.setup` to prepare Tailwind CSS and Esbuild.
4. **Start Server:** Launch the Phoenix server (powered by Bandit) by running `mix phx.server`.
5. **Access the App:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000`.

### Instructions for using the software:

1. **Filter & Sort:** Use the controls at the top to select a category (Animals, Shapes, or Food) and choose between "A-Z" or "Shuffle" mode.
2. **Interact:** Look at the visual prompt, guess the answer, and click "Show Answer" to reveal the card details.
3. **Navigate:** Click "Next Card" to move through the deck and watch the progress bar fill up.
4. **Finish:** Reach the end of the deck to trigger the completion screen!

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and libraries:

- **Elixir**: ~> 1.19
- **Erlang/OTP**: Version 28+
- **Phoenix Framework**: ~> 1.8.3
- **Web Server**: Bandit ~> 1.5
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / Supabase
- **UI/Assets**: Tailwind CSS ~> 0.3 and Heroicons v2.2.0

## Future Work

The following items are planned to improve and scale the application:

- [ ] **Database Migration:** Implement local PostgreSQL storage before migrating the database to **Supabase** for cloud-based scalability.
- [ ] **Authentication & User Management:** Add secure user registration and login to allow parents to manage progress and custom decks.
- [ ] **TDD Implementation:** Adopt a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach using `Mox` and `ExMachina` to ensure 100% test coverage for new features.
- [ ] **Full-Scale Implementation:** Expand the existing LiveView demo into a full-scale application with expanded categories and interactive progress tracking.
